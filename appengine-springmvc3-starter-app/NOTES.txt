This is an offshoot from an early branch of the swagswap project
that is a good starting point for a spring mvc appengine app. 
It includes incoming mail support.  See the swagswap project for 
security, JSF, GWT, and more.

To deploy this yourself, ensure that the from address in MailController 
is a registered developer (admin) in your appengine application

to add an item via mail, send an email to add@springstarterapp.appspotmail.com
with the item name in the subject and an optional attached image.
